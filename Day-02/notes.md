## Day 2: Add Two Numbers â€“ Notes

### What I Learned:
- Used the concept of a dummy node to simplify handling of the resulting linked list.
- Carefully handled the `carry` and edge cases when the lists are of unequal length.
- Python ternary (`val1 = l1.val if l1 else 0`) helps simplify null checks.

### Key Concepts:
- Linked List traversal
- Carry handling in addition
- Creating a new linked list dynamically

### What to Improve:
- Need more practice on edge cases (e.g., lists of different lengths, multiple carryovers)
- Try to implement this using recursion later

### Next Steps:
- Try the same problem recursively or with real test cases using helper functions
- Practice similar problems like "Multiply Strings" or "Add Binary"
