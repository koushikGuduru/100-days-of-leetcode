## Notes: Longest Palindromic Substring

### âœ… Approach:
We expand around each character (center) to check for the longest palindromic substring.  
There are two types of centers:
- Odd-length palindromes: one center (i)
- Even-length palindromes: two centers (i, i+1)

### âœ… Steps:
1. Initialize `start` and `end` pointers.
2. For each character, expand outward while characters on both sides are equal.
3. Track the maximum length and update `start` and `end`.

### âœ… Time Complexity:
- O(n^2) â€” we check each possible center and expand.
- O(1) space â€” we don't use extra space apart from pointers.

### ðŸ§  Tips:
- Palindromes mirror around a center.
- Use helper function `expandAroundCenter` for clean logic.
